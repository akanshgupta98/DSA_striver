Algorithms in this section:
1. To extract last no from a integer: modulus by 10. (N % 10)
2. Palindrome-> If reverse matches the original, it is a Palindrome
3. GCD -> Euclidean Algorithm:
    GCD (A,b) = GCD(A-b,b), if A > b
    When A or B == 0 , we found the GCD. 
    Ex: 20,15 -> 5,15 -> 10,5 -> 5,5 0,5
4. For finding the divisors, we need to only loop till sqrt(N)
    Logic:
        lets look at divisors of 12. 
        12:
            1x12
            2x6
            3x4
            4x3
            6x2
            12x1
    so it can be seen that after 3 square, the image becomes mirror. 
    so it repeats. Will be more clear when take example of 36. 
        36:
            1x36
            2x18
            3x12
            4x9
            6x6
            9x4
            12x3
            18x2
            36x1
    In this, it can be clearly seen that after 6x6, the divisors repeat. 
    so, we can say that sqrt(N) will be a turning point.
